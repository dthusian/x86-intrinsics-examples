# x86 Intrinsics Examples

This repository contains many example programs for working with x86 intrinsics.

Examples:
- `vector-math`: Vectorised math
- `vector-math-avx`: Faster vectorised math with AVX
- `hardware-rng`: Hardware random number generation

You can use [Intel's Intrinsics reference](https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/#!)
for finding specific functions.
