# x86 Intrinsics Examples

This repository contains many example programs for working with x86 intrinsics.

Examples:
- `vector-math`: Vectorised math
- `vector-math-avx`: Faster vectorised math with AVX
- `hardware-rng`: Hardware random number generation
- `aes-new-instructions`: AES implemented with specialized intrinsics
- `string-operations`: (WIP) Some C Library string operations implemented with intrinsics
- `histogram-avx512`: (WIP) Using AVX512-CD to populate a histogram without undefined behavior.
- `simd-sandbox`: (Planned) Interactive sandbox to visualize SSE, AVX, and AVX512 operations
